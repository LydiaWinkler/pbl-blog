I lost all my nerves while writing code for my project but as programmer there is no other option than keep working.
I'm Lydia Winkler and I started a project called __GigglyGraphics__ during my participation at the Java programming course at __everyone codes__. GigglyGraphics is for artists who wants to improve their skills by repeating a selfmade list of tasks. One of the features is to upload an Image of their drawings after finishing the task. And this blog post is about my experience with this feature.

# Requirements

So, to provide a bit of background, the requirements for my app were as follows:
- The user should be able to add and delete single tasks as well as a whole list of tasks.
- The user should be able to archive and reactivate single tasks wether the task is needed or not.
- The user should be able to choose if he/she wants the next task of the list or a random one.
- The user should be able to add a snapshot to the task.
    __Snapshots includes the Image, a selfrating and a field where the user can enter the mistakes he/she recogniced.__
- The User should be able to view the snapshot as well as the task itself.
- All Images should be displayed in a galery and after clicking on a single Image they should be navigated to the view of the snapshot where the image is included.
